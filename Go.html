      <h1>Origin Of Fanta</h1> 
    <h3>Notice: Some of the information presented is yet to be identified</h3>   
       <p><strong>Fanta</strong> originated during World War 2, in <strong>Nazi Germany.</strong> Before the war, coke was a very popular drink in Europe, especially in Germany. When Hitler came into power and started to declare war on other countries, Coca-cola started to stop exporting its products in Germany. Since coke was loved by many germans, they started to horde all the remaining bottles, leaving none left. Hitler wanted to recreate the formula for coke, so that he can provide for his citizens. He went to his commander and ordered him to recreate the formula. The commander was lucky enough to have one last bottle of coke in his inventory. So he began to experiment with many different ingredients, trying to recreate the classic flavor of coke. In the end, he did not recreate the classic flavor of coke, but instead, he created a new soda, which he called Fanta. He realized that he can't recreate the original flavor, but he did create a formula very similar to it.</p>
       
  <p>Hitler was shocked to find that the commander's formula was sweater than coca cola. Hitler then started to market Fanta in Germany. It eventually became popular even outside Germany. After the war, Fanta spread all around the world. The company sells over half-a-billion Fanta bottles per year. The company has a net-worth of 205 billion USD. The fanta drink is now enjoyed all around the world. Who knew that a drink made by a Nazi commander, would become a world wide hit.</p>
